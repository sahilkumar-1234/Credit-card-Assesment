# 💳 Credit Card Assessment

This project is designed to analyze and assess credit card users based on various features such as credit limit, purchases, payments, and other financial indicators. The goal is to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, clustering, and possibly prediction for better customer segmentation and insights.
